Step 0 – Prepping RHEL 7
If you have just downloaded the RHEL 7 ISO as part of the developer subscription model we will need to perform some initial tasks to get it up to scratch

Authenticate your subscription
subscription-manager register --username your_username --password your_password

Update the OS
yum update && yum upgrade

Let’s install some classics such as ifconfig & wget Shell
yum install net-tools

yum install wget

yum install net-tools

yum install wget

We also need access to the “Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux” for downloading packages outside the normal channels

wget https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
rpm -ivh epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
yum install epel-release

wget https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm

rpm -ivh epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm

yum install epel-release


So at this point we should have a RHEL 7 instance ready to go.

Step 1 – Installing Python, Python Tooling & Ansible
We’ll install Python first

sudo yum install python

Next we’ll install PIP which is a “package management system used to install and manage software packages written in Python”

sudo yum install python-pip

Now we need to upgrade it

sudo pip install --upgrade pip
Next we’ll use PIP to install some liraries and modules for python & Ansible

sudo pip install markupsafe
sudo pip install xmltodict
sudo pip install pywinrm

And finally we will install Ansible
sudo yum install ansible

To confirm that it has been installed correctly we’ll execute
ansible --version

Which should generate the following output
[asecor@labansc]$ ansible --version
ansible 2.1.2.0
  config file = /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
  configured module search path = Default w/o overrides

[asecor@labansc]$ ansible --version
ansible 2.1.2.0
  config file = /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
  configured module search path = Default w/o overrides

Done! We now have a working Ansible installation on Red Hat Linux 7!
