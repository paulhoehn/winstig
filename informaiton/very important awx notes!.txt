Here's how I fixed this issue: Refer Docker Compose documentation

sudo curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.21.0/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m) -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

After you do the curl command , it'll put docker-compose into the

/usr/local/bin

which is not on the PATH. To fix it, create a symbolic link:

sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/docker-compose /usr/bin/docker-compose
And now if you do: docker-compose --version

You'll see that docker-compose is now on the PATH
